Overview

This project is designed to monitor network traffic in real time. It does the following:
	‚Ä¢	Captures network packets: Constantly listens for network traffic.
	‚Ä¢	Analyzes traffic: Detects potential security threats.
	‚Ä¢	Displays data interactively: Uses a web interface to show real-time events, statistics, and alerts.

Project Structure

A quick look at the folder layout shows how the project is organized:

network-security-dashboard/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packet_sniffer.py     # Captures packets, analyzes data, and runs the WebSocket server
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                # Contains database models and REST API endpoints
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt      # Lists all Python package dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html            # The main HTML page for the dashboard
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css            # Styling rules for the dashboard
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js             # Contains frontend logic and real-time update functions
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json          # Lists Node.js dependencies for frontend development
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                 # This documentation file

Why this matters:
Understanding the project structure helps you know where to look if you need to change the backend logic, update the user interface, or manage dependencies.

	‚Ä¢	Download Python
	‚Ä¢	Purpose: Runs the backend packet capture and analysis.
	2.	Node.js (LTS)
	‚Ä¢	Download Node.js
	‚Ä¢	Purpose: Runs the frontend development server.
	‚Ä¢	Note: Minimum version 14.x.

Installation

Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:

git clone https://github.com/SDL101/network-security-dashboard.git
cd network-security-dashboard

Why this step?
This downloads the project to your local machine so you can start working with it.

Step 2: Setup the Backend

Create and activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies:

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# For Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# For macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required Python packages
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

Why this step?
Isolating dependencies in a virtual environment avoids conflicts with other projects.

Step 3: Setup the Frontend

Navigate to the frontend directory and install Node.js packages:

cd frontend
npm install

Why this step?
This installs all required packages to run the frontend development server.

Running the Application

1. Start the Backend Server

Make sure your virtual environment is active, then run:

python backend/packet_sniffer.py

Why this step?
This starts the packet capture and analysis engine that monitors network traffic.

2. Start the Frontend Development Server

In a new terminal, start the frontend:

cd frontend
npm start

Why this step?
This serves the interactive dashboard on your browser.

Access the Dashboard:
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000.

Usage Guide

Basic Operations
	1.	Start Monitoring:
	‚Ä¢	Click the ‚ÄúStart Capture‚Äù button on the dashboard.
	‚Ä¢	Note: You may need administrator privileges.
	‚Ä¢	The dashboard will begin displaying real-time network statistics.
	2.	View and Filter Events:
	‚Ä¢	Use dropdown menus and stat boxes to filter events by type.
	‚Ä¢	Search using parameters like IP address, time range, or severity level.
	3.	Export Data:
	‚Ä¢	Click ‚ÄúExport Logs as CSV‚Äù to save the current view.
	‚Ä¢	Files are saved with a timestamp for easy identification.

Code Examples

Event Detection Logic (Backend)

Located in backend/packet_sniffer.py, this snippet shows how network packets are captured and processed:

def start_sniffing():
    print("üõ°Ô∏è  Network monitoring ready...")
    try:
        # Capture packets that match the "ip" filter and analyze them
        sniff(filter="ip", prn=detect_threat, store=False)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in packet sniffing: {e}")

def signal_handler(sig, frame):
    print("Shutting down...")
    global is_capturing
    is_capturing = False  # Stop packet capture
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit the application

def is_private_ip(ip):
    try:
        # Returns True if the IP is within a private range
        return ipaddress.ip_address(ip).is_private
    except:
        return False

def format_stats():
    current_time = time.time()
    uptime = int(current_time - stats["start_time"])
    return {
        "packets_analyzed": stats.get("packets_analyzed", 0),
        "threats_detected": stats.get("threats_detected", 0),
        "active_ips": len(stats.get("active_ips", set())),
        "scan_status": "Normal",
        "uptime_seconds": uptime
    }

Real-time Updates (Frontend)

Located in frontend/script.js, this snippet shows how new log messages are handled:

activeSocket.on("new_log", function (data) {
  if (!isCapturing || !data) return;
  if (isCapturePaused) {
    queuedLogs.push(data.log);
  } else {
    if (data.log) addLogEntry(data.log);
    if (data.stats) updateStats(data.stats);
  }
});

I‚Äôve included these code examples to provide insight into how the dashboard processes and displays data and to help developers better understand the inner workings of the application.

Troubleshooting

Common Issues and How to Solve Them
	1.	Permission Errors:
	‚Ä¢	Windows: Run the terminal as Administrator.
	‚Ä¢	Linux/macOS: Use sudo python backend/packet_sniffer.py if needed.
	2.	Port Conflicts:
	‚Ä¢	Backend (port 5000): Check with netstat -ano | findstr 5000
	‚Ä¢	Frontend (port 8000): Check with netstat -ano | findstr 8000
	3.	Connection Issues:
	‚Ä¢	Verify that the backend is running (look for the üõ°Ô∏è indicator).
	‚Ä¢	Check the browser console for errors.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure firewall settings allow the connections.
